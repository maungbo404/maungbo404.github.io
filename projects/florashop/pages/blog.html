        <p> White roses symbolize loyalty, purity, and innocence. "Since they represent these ideas, the white rose has
          also become the most popular flower to be seen at weddings," says Poulson. According to Poulson, they can also
          symbolize eternal love, a new start, and fresh beginnings.</p><br>

          Red poppy flowers represent consolation, remembrance and death. Likewise, the poppy is a common symbol that

        <h2>Lily</h2>
        <p> The lily is often associated with the story of Hera and Zeus, though the calla lily can be associated with
          this story as well. According to the myth, Zeus wanted baby Hercules to drink the milk of Hera, his wife.
          Because Hercules was born of another woman, Hera disagreed. Zeus brought Hercules to Hera to drink her milk
          while she was sleeping, but she awoke and pushed him away. The drops of milk that spilled on the ground grew
          into lilies.</p><br>
