    <h2 align="center">Early Life</h2>
    <p>&emsp; &emsp; John Christopher Depp II was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky, the youngest of four
        children of
        waitress Betty Sue Palmer (née Wells) and civil engineer John Christopher Depp. Depp's family moved frequently
        during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970. His parents divorced in 1978 when he was
        15, and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called "an inspiration"</p>

    <p>&emsp; &emsp; Depp's mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands. He dropped
        out of Miramar
        High School at 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the
        principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. In 1980, Depp began playing in a band called The
        Kids. After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing
        its name to Six Gun Method. In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in
        telemarketing. In December 1983, Depp married makeup artist Lori Anne Allison, the sister of his band's bassist
        and singer. The Kids split up before signing a record deal in 1984, and Depp began collaborating with the band
        Rock City Angels. He co-wrote their song "Mary", which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's
        Blues. Depp and Allison divorced in 1985</p>

    <h2 align="center">Career</h2>
    <h3 align="center">2021–2022: Big-Screen Return and multiple European film awards
    </h3>
    <p><b>&emsp; &emsp; In March 2021</b>, City of Lies, which was originally scheduled for 2018, was released in theaters and
        streaming
        services. The same month, an online petition to bring Depp back to the Pirates franchise, begun four months
        earlier, reached its goal of 500,000 signatures. His Pirates co-star Kevin McNally also expressed support for
        Depp returning to the role</p>

    <p><b>&emsp; &emsp; In May 2022</b> Johnny Depp stated that since Hollywood has boycotted him, he chose to make a big screen
        return overseas as King Louis XV, a.k.a. Louis the Beloved. The French-language movie directed by French
        actor-director Maïwenn, titled Jeanne Du Barry will mark Depp's first feature since 2020's Minamata. Film
        shooting will take place primarily at the Versailles Palace and is set to begin in the summer of 2022. In
        addition to Depp, Louis Garrel, Pierre Richard and Noemie Lvovsky would be part of the cast, along with Maïwenn
        who will play Madame du Barry, the king's last known mistress.</p>
